# Professional_Blog_Site

A dynamic blog web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. This application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. This project showcases skills in back-end development with Express.js, templating with EJS, and responsive front-end design. The application does not store posts persistently but simulates content for session-based usage as no database is used in this version.

 . The app is designed to be responsive and showcases full-stack skills.
