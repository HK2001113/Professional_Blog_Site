# Professional_Blog_Site
 "A dynamic blog web application built with Node.js, Express.js, and EJS, allowing users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. This project showcases skills in back-end development with Express.js, templating with EJS, and responsive front-end design. The application does not store posts persistently but simulates content for session-based usage. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to create a functional blog site with efficient routing, form handling, and styling."
